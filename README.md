# Linear-Regression-with-removing-outliers
This GitHub repository is designed to showcase an end-to-end approach to handling complex synthetic data in the context of machine learning. Specifically, the focus is on demonstrating effective techniques for data generation, outlier detection and removal, model training, and the comparison of different modeling approaches. It serves as a practical guide and resource for data scientists and researchers interested in enhancing their machine learning workflows with robust preprocessing and modeling strategies.

### Key Objectives
The primary objectives of this repository are to:
- **Generate Complex Synthetic Data**: Create realistic, synthetic datasets that mimic real-world data complexities, suitable for testing and developing machine learning models.
- **Remove Outliers**: Implement robust statistical methods to identify and remove outliers that can skew the results and performance of predictive models.
- **Train Linear Regression Models**: Develop and refine linear regression models to predict outcomes based on the cleaned data.
- **Compare Models**: Evaluate the performance of the traditional linear regression model against predictions from advanced, possibly pre-trained or specialized module-based models.
- **Visualize Results**: Use visualization tools to illustrate the comparison between predicted and actual values, providing a clear visual representation of model performance.

### Utility and Application
This repository is useful for:
- Students and newcomers to data science looking to understand the steps involved in preparing data and building their first predictive models.
- Experienced data scientists seeking to refine their skills in specific areas like outlier removal or model comparison.
- Educators and trainers who need real-world examples to teach data handling and machine learning concepts.
- Developers and analysts in industries where predictive modeling plays a crucial role, offering them insights into improving model accuracy and reliability.
